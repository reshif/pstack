# Interrogate

Spawn one reviewer per configured model to adversarially review code changes. Each reviewer gets the same prompt and rubric.

The adversarial signal comes from model diversity where the host offers it. Where it does not, the signal comes from assigned stances instead: keep the reviewer count, give each one a distinct stance from `runtime/delegation.md` (`adversary`, `operator`, `maintainer`, plus the code-quality lens), and keep them blind to each other. Say which of the two you ran on, because they are not equally strong evidence.

The deliverable is a synthesized verdict. Do NOT auto-apply changes.

## Step 1, Determine Scope

Identify what to review from context:

- If the user points at specific files or a diff, use that
- If on a feature branch, run `git diff main...HEAD` (or the appropriate base branch) for the full changeset
- If the user's message references recent work, gather the relevant files

Package the diff (or file contents) plus any surrounding context files the reviewers need to understand the code.

## Step 2, State the Intent

Before spawning reviewers, state the intent explicitly. Derive this from:

- The user's message
- Commit messages
- PR description if one exists
- The code itself

Write one clear paragraph. If you're unsure about the intent, ask the user before proceeding.

## Step 3, Spawn Reviewers

Launch all reviewers in a single message using the delegation protocol (`runtime/delegation.md`). Use the `interrogate-reviewers` list from `.pstack/models.md` when present, one reviewer per entry, extending or shrinking the Reviewer A/B/C/D labels below to the configured entry count. Otherwise use the table defaults.

| Subagent | Default model |
|----------|---------------|
| Reviewer A | `panel[0]` |
| Reviewer B | `panel[1]` |
| Reviewer C | `panel[2]` |
| Reviewer D | `panel[3]` |

Take the entries from the `panel` pool in order (`runtime/roles.md`). Where the host offers fewer
distinct models than reviewers, do not repeat a model: keep the reviewer count and give each a
distinct stance from `runtime/delegation.md` instead. Two reviewers on the same model with the same
prompt is one reviewer billed twice.

For each reviewer:
- `role`: `pstack-reviewer` (read-only delegate)
- `model`: the configured `interrogate-reviewers` entry, or the table default with no configured line
- `access`: `read`

If a model slug is rejected as unresolvable when you try to spawn the subagent, check the valid identifiers named in the host's error message, pick the closest equivalent (prefer the highest-reasoning tier of the same family), spawn with the valid slug, and open a separate PR to update the configured value or default table. Do not block the review on the slug issue. If the configured value is `inherit-parent` or `auto`, omit `model` instead. Never treat those aliases as broken slugs or enter this fallback for them.

Read `references/reviewer-prompt.md` and fill in the template with:
1. The stated intent
2. The diff or file contents
3. The review rubric from `references/rubric.md`
4. The code-quality lens from `references/code-quality-review.md`

The same filled template goes to all reviewers, so every model applies the code-quality lens.

## Step 4, Synthesize

As results come back, build a unified picture:

1. **Parse all findings** from the reviewers
2. **Identify consensus**. Findings raised by 2+ models independently are highest signal.
3. **Identify lone-model findings**. Still worth reading, but weight accordingly.
4. **Deduplicate**. Different models may describe the same issue differently. Merge these and note which models raised it.
5. **Note disagreements**. If one model flags something and another explicitly says the opposite, that's useful context for the verdict.

## Step 5, Lead Judgment

You are the lead reviewer, a pragmatic senior engineer, not a neutral aggregator.

Read `references/lead-judgment.md` for the full framework.

Categorize every finding using these buckets:

- **Act on**. Real issues affecting correctness, security, or maintainability given the actual goals. These would block a real PR.
- **Consider**. Legitimate points, but you're not sure they outweigh the cost of addressing them right now. Worth the user's attention.
- **Noted**. Technically valid but not actionable. Context-dependent, premature optimization, or low-impact given the current stage.
- **Dismissed**. Wrong, nitpicky, or missing context. Brief explanation why.

For each finding, include:
- Which model(s) raised it
- The category (act on / consider / noted / dismissed)
- A one-line rationale for the categorization

## Returning to the caller

The verdict is this skill's whole output. When a playbook step called it, the caller owns what
happens next. Each Act-on finding the caller accepts goes back to that playbook's implementation
step, and the changed code reruns its cleanup, review and verification. A finding the caller
declines to fix stays open in the caller's reply, with the reason. Interrogate reruns on the fix
only when the caller asks.

## Output Format

Present the verdict in this structure:

### Intent
> [The stated intent paragraph from Step 2]

### Reviewers
- Reviewer [label]: [model name], [N findings] (one bullet per reviewer)

### Act On
[Findings that should be addressed. For each: description, which models raised it, why it matters.]

### Consider
[Findings worth thinking about. For each: description, which models raised it, tradeoff involved.]

### Noted
[Valid but low-priority. Brief list.]

### Dismissed
[Rejected findings with brief rationale.]

### Agreement Map
[Where did models agree, where did they diverge, and what does the pattern of agreement/disagreement tell us?]
